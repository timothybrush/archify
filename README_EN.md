# Archify

**Generate beautiful architecture, technical workflow, sequence, data-flow, and lifecycle diagrams in chat. Switch dark / light. Copy to clipboard or export crisp up-to-4× PNG / JPEG / WebP / SVG.**

Archify is an agent skill for Claude, Codex CLI, and opencode. It turns a plain-English description of your system or process into a polished, self-contained technical diagram — a single HTML file you can open, toggle themes on, copy to the clipboard, and export at maximum resolution.

- **No design skills needed** — describe your architecture in English, get a diagram
- **Workflow, sequence, data-flow, and lifecycle diagrams too** — technical flows, approvals, tool calls, CI/CD, runbooks, request call chains, data pipelines, PII boundaries, and state machines can be drawn
- **Built-in theme toggle** — one click between dark and light, persists across sessions
- **Copy PNG to clipboard** — one click, paste straight into Slack / Notion / GitHub
- **Ultra-crisp image export** — PNG / JPEG / WebP rendered natively at up to 4× source resolution (no upsampling blur), or SVG for true vector
- **SVG follows system dark/light** — exported SVGs ship with both variable sets + `@media (prefers-color-scheme)`, so dropping one into a GitHub README makes it follow the reader's color preference (no more two PNGs wrapped in `<picture>`)
- **Validation loop built in** — renderer-backed diagrams go through JSON schema validation, layout checks, HTML/SVG artifact checks, and targeted iteration
- **Semantic tech labels** — describe components as `aws.lambda`, `postgres`, `redis`, `github-actions`, `openai`, etc.; Archify maps them to the right visual category without needing a full icon library
- **Self-contained HTML** — the generated file has zero dependencies, share by sending it
- **Iterate by chat** — "add Redis", "move auth to the left", "use emerald for the API"

**Project page:** [tt-a1i.github.io/archify](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/)

**Start in 60 seconds:**

```bash
npx skills add tt-a1i/archify -g
```

Then ask your agent: `Use archify to map this repository's runtime architecture.`

## Preview

Same diagram, two themes, one click to switch:

| Dark | Light |
|---|---|
| ![Dark theme](docs/assets/archify-dark.png) | ![Light theme](docs/assets/archify-light.png) |

The Export menu — Copy PNG to clipboard plus 4 download formats (all raster exports at up to 4× source resolution):

![Export menu](docs/assets/archify-menu.png)

Example file: [`examples/web-app.html`](examples/web-app.html). Download or clone the repository, open the file locally, then press <kbd>T</kbd> to toggle themes or <kbd>E</kbd> to open Export.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
npx skills add tt-a1i/archify -g
```

This installs Archify for supported agents through the open-source [`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

To try it without a permanent install:

```bash
npx skills use tt-a1i/archify@archify --agent codex
```

Replace `codex` with `claude-code` or `opencode` when needed.

### 2. Ask for one clear view

Start with an overview instead of asking one diagram to explain the entire repository:

```text
Analyze this repository, then use archify to create a high-level runtime architecture diagram.
Show 8–12 core components, one primary request or data path, external dependencies, and trust boundaries.
Put supporting detail in cards instead of adding more edges.
```

For a focused flow:

```text
Use archify to draw this login flow: Browser -> Web App -> API -> JWT validation ->
Redis session lookup -> PostgreSQL fallback. Make the cache-miss path secondary.
```

### 3. Refine in chat

Ask for focused changes such as `add Redis`, `move auth to the left`, or `highlight the rollback path` while the source JSON remains available in the session.

Archify returns a self-contained HTML file that opens in any modern browser and exports to PNG, JPEG, WebP, or SVG.

## Diagram types

Choose the view that matches the question you need to answer:

| Type | Best for | Include in your prompt |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Components, services, storage, boundaries | Scope, core components, primary path |
| **Workflow** | CI/CD, approvals, tool calls, runbooks | Participants, order, branches, exceptions |
| **Sequence** | API calls, cache fallback, auth, async traces | Callers, callees, returns, timing |
| **Data Flow** | Pipelines, lineage, PII, downstream consumers | Sources, transforms, stores, boundaries |
| **Lifecycle** | State machines, retries, waits, terminal states | States, events, retry and cancellation paths |

Architecture examples:

- [`examples/web-app.html`](examples/web-app.html) — compact SaaS architecture
- [`examples/archify-repo.html`](examples/archify-repo.html) — Archify's skill → JSON IR → renderer pipeline
- [`examples/archify-repo-grid.html`](examples/archify-repo-grid.html) — explicit `row` / `col` grid placement
- [`examples/maka-architecture.html`](examples/maka-architecture.html) — a third-party desktop agent workbench

Workflow uses swimlanes, a clear happy path, and restrained secondary branches.

![Workflow example](docs/assets/archify-workflow.png)

Sequence focuses on one interaction over time.

![Sequence example](docs/assets/archify-sequence.png)

Data Flow makes movement, transformation, and sensitivity boundaries explicit.

![Data Flow example](docs/assets/archify-dataflow.png)

Lifecycle separates normal progress, wait states, retries, and terminal outcomes.

## Why Archify

- **Layout judgment over generic auto-layout** — the agent chooses hierarchy, spacing, routes, and emphasis for the story being told.
- **Typed JSON IR** — architecture, workflow, sequence, data-flow, and lifecycle diagrams use renderer-backed schemas.
- **Validation before delivery** — schema, layout, HTML, and SVG checks catch malformed or unreadable output early.
- **Portable output** — one HTML file, no server or framework required, with local font fallbacks when external fonts are unavailable.
- **Semantic technology labels** — names such as `postgres`, `redis`, `aws.lambda`, and `github-actions` guide visual categorization without a heavyweight icon runtime.

Archify is not a general-purpose drawing editor or a Mermaid theme. Its job is to turn technical intent into a polished communication artifact.

## Installation options

The primary installation command is:

```bash
npx skills add tt-a1i/archify -g
```

The same [`archify.zip`](archify.zip) can also be installed manually:

| Surface | Install location or method | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` | Full renderer + validation workflow |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.agents/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` | Full renderer + validation workflow |
| **opencode** | `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` | Full renderer + validation workflow |
| **Claude.ai** | Upload `archify.zip` under Settings → Capabilities → Skills | Depends on Node.js access in the sandbox |
| **Project Knowledge** | Upload `archify.zip` to the project | Prompt-driven architecture mode only |

Manual installation means unzipping the archive into the matching directory. No `npm install` is required for the packaged skill.

## How it works

Renderer-backed diagrams follow a small, inspectable loop:

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Generate JSON IR** | The agent creates a typed description instead of hand-editing final SVG markup. |
| **Validate** | Bundled standalone validators check the schema without installing runtime dependencies. |
| **Render** | The selected renderer produces the HTML/SVG artifact. |
| **Check** | Layout and artifact checks catch invalid coordinates, malformed SVG, and unsafe routes. |
| **Iterate** | Targeted changes are applied to the JSON IR while unrelated structure stays stable. |

The packaged CLI exposes the same workflow. From a repository checkout:

```bash
cd archify
node bin/archify.mjs doctor
node bin/archify.mjs demo /tmp/archify-demo
node bin/archify.mjs render workflow examples/agent-tool-call.workflow.json /tmp/workflow.html
node bin/archify.mjs validate workflow examples/agent-tool-call.workflow.json --json
node bin/archify.mjs check /tmp/workflow.html
node bin/archify.mjs examples
```

Optional trace animation can be enabled for demos:

```json
{ "meta": { "title": "Release Flow", "animation": "trace" } }
```

The animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Omit `animation` for a static diagram.

## Using the output

Open the generated HTML in a modern browser. The controls in the top-right provide:

- **Theme** — switch between dark and light. Shortcut: <kbd>T</kbd>.
- **Export** — copy PNG or download PNG, JPEG, WebP, or SVG. Shortcut: <kbd>E</kbd>.

| Format | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **Copy PNG** | Slack, Notion, GitHub comments, and quick reviews |
| **PNG / JPEG / WebP** | Slides, documents, websites, and print |
| **SVG** | READMEs, blogs, Figma, Illustrator, and lossless scaling |

Raster exports are rendered natively at the highest safe resolution, up to 4×. Oversized diagrams step down automatically to stay within browser canvas limits.

Exported SVGs include dark and light variables plus `prefers-color-scheme`, so one SVG can follow the reader's system theme.

Useful URL parameters:

- `?theme=light` or `?theme=dark` — force the starting theme.
- `?openExport=1` — open the Export menu on load.

WebP and clipboard support depend on browser capabilities. The HTML uses local font fallbacks when an external font cannot be loaded.

## Prompt patterns

**Repository overview**

```text
Map this repository's runtime architecture with no more than 12 core components.
Show the main request path, external systems, and trust boundaries. Move implementation detail into cards.
```

**CI/CD workflow**

```text
Draw a CI/CD workflow: pull request -> tests -> approval -> build image -> staging ->
smoke test -> production. Show rollback as a secondary failure path.
```

**Data lineage**

```text
Draw a data-flow diagram from Web and Mobile events through Consent Gate, Kafka,
Warehouse, and Feature Store to Dashboards and ML consumers. Mark the PII boundary.
```

## Current status and roadmap

Archify 2.10 already uses typed JSON IR across all five renderer-backed modes. Current work focuses on stabilizing local edits, improving layout diagnostics, and keeping generated artifacts easy to inspect and share.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned work and design boundaries. Automatic Mermaid parsing, generic auto-layout, a hosted sharing service, and a WYSIWYG editor are not current goals.
